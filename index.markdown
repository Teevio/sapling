Stephen Hallgren (aka. Teevio) has been living and breathing all things related to the internet for as long as he can remember.

Teevio is CTO (Chief Technology of Officer) of Audios Ventures, the home of [Simplecast](https://simplecast.com); a podcasting and analytics platform empowering audio creators with the tools they need to share their stories, evolve their craft, and connect with a world of listeners.

In the not so distant past he has worked with everyone from 3D design pioneer Autodesk to Nasty Gal, Dictionary.com and Virb. 

Teevio currently lives in the great and grandiose city of Albany, NY [sarcasm intended] with his wife, 4 children and Bernese Mountain Dog. Aside from programming, he enjoys long walks on the beach, reading, playing guitar, taking photos, and hanging out with his family.

If you’re ever in town, stop by and say “Hi.”
